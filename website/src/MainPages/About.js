          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Our ELEC498 Capstone Project at Queen's University introduces an innovative Autonomous Driver Examination System, aiming to revolutionize the current driver testing methodology in Ontario. This system is designed to address the challenges faced by the existing G2 and G driver testing processes at DriveTest centres, such as scheduling difficulties, inconsistent evaluation standards, and prolonged waiting periods. By integrating advanced technology, our project endeavors to enhance the fairness, speed, and accuracy of driver examinations, ultimately contributing to safer roads in Ontario.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Autonomous Driver Examination System is a pivotal solution that targets the inefficiencies of the current driver testing framework in Ontario. With a significant increase in automobile fatalities and the need for more consistent and unbiased driver assessments, our project stands at the forefront of change. The primary objective is to develop a technology-driven system that can accurately evaluate a driver's performance in real-life scenarios, starting with the execution of a safe lane change. This system not only aims to improve the examination process but also offers a unique training tool for aspiring drivers.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The system operates using a blend of sophisticated hardware and software. It employs a three-camera setup to monitor the vehicle's surroundings and the driver's actions, along with an accelerometer to track the vehicle's speed. This data is analyzed in real-time by an advanced computer vision model, which then assesses the driver's ability to safely perform a lane change. The evaluation results are instantly sent to the driver's mobile device, offering immediate and precise feedback. This innovative approach ensures a fair and comprehensive assessment of driving skills, surpassing the capabilities of traditional human examiners.</p>
